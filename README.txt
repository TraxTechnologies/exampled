Simple example python daemon

The purpose of this is to provide an example for learning about unix daemons
and some caviates when programming them.

This daemon does not do much:
 - Counts the number of loop iterations
 - Attempts to print that count to standard out
 - Prints the count to a log file
 - Sleeps 30 seconds
